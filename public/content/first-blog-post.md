# My First Blog Post

Welcome to my first blog post! This is a sample post to demonstrate how Markdown can be used to create rich content for your blog.

## Features

- **Bold** and *italic* text
- Lists (like this one)
- [Links](https://example.com)
- Code blocks

```javascript
function helloWorld() {
  console.log('Hello, World!');
}
```

## Conclusion

Markdown is a great way to write content for your blog. It's simple, yet powerful enough to create well-structured and visually appealing posts.
